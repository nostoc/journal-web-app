# journal-web-app
In this Web Application project I'll use the Django package to create a simple web application that allows users to keep a journal about different topics they’ve been learning about. Users will create an account with a username and password, enter a topic, and then make entries about what they’re learning.I’ll also deploy your app to a remote server so anyone in the world can access it.
After completing this project, I’ll be able to start building my own simple web applications, and I’ll be ready to delve into more thorough resources on building applications with Django.
